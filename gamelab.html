		<h2>My internship at:</h2>
		<h1>GameLab Oost</h1>

		<img src="images/GameLabOost.png" alt="GameLab Oost logo">

		<p>I spent half a year at GameLab Oost / Breathe Audio as an intern, followed by an additional few months to
			work on some smaller-scale projects.</p>
		<p>I've had a lot of fun and enjoyed my time there. It was a great first internship.</p>
		<h2>I've made the following this during my time at GameLab Oost / Breathe Audio:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Driver's Theory Exam - mobile serious game</li>
			<li>Obstacle course - iPad minigame</li>
			<li>BattleShips - iPad minigame</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>On this page, I'll talk a bit more about these projects.</h2>

				<h2>My internship assignment</h2>
				<p>My assignment for this internship was to make a mobile serious-game for intellectually disabled
					people who struggle to study for their driver's theory exam.</p>
				<p>As the programmer in a team, I worked on creating all functionality in the game. This included UI, Level selection, driving simulation, setting up question-situations, creating a levelling-system, game economy and the customizable car.</p>
				<p>The design and assets were made by some very talented Saxion students at the time.</p>
				<p>This was the first ambitious project I worked on. Looking back on it, I am still impressed by the overall product. It was a succesfull first prototype, as the company continued the idea forward with a new team.</p>

				<h2>Additional projects</h2>
				<p>After the internship was over, GameLab Oost asked me to stay for an additional few months to help out on one of their projects at the time.</p>
				<p>My new task was to make 2 mini-games for one of their iPad apps. These 2 games were made simultaneously so managing the 2 was a challenge.</p>
				<br>
				<p>More on them below.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="intern_obstaclecourse">
				<h1>Obstacle Course</h1>

				<h2>Fun to make</h2>
				<p>From the 2 projects, this one seemed the most interesting. The design was mostly set in stone, so I all I had to do was make it.</p>
				<p>The game is controlled though touch-controls on an iPad. The player will move one tile into the input-direction, snapping to moving tiles to make the game more accessible to the target audience.</p>

			<section class="intern_battleships">
				<h1>BattleShips</h1>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/BattleShips1.gif" alt="Obstacle course GIF">					
				</figure>
				<h2>Project</h2>
				<p>BattleShips is a classic boardgame, and recreating it in Unity was a fun challenge. I'm happy with how the project came together in such a small amount of time.</p>
				<p>It's played in 2 phases. Setup and gameplay.</p>

				<h2>Setup</h2>
				<p>The setup phase is where the player sets up their battleships. They can't overlap or stick outside the board.</p>
				<p>After the player places their ships and confirms, it's the CPU's turn to generate random ship-positions. These are the exact same ships as the player uses.</p>				
				<p></p>

				<figure><img src="images/BattleShips2.png" alt="Obstacle course GIF"></figure>
				<h2>Gameplay</h2>
				<p>After that, it's time for the player to guess where the CPU has placed their ships and vice versa. Each time the CPU hits a player ship, it'll sink on the bottom board.</p>
				<p>If the player guesses ship's position correctly, it'll be marked with an O on the map. Guess wrong and it'll be an X.</p>
